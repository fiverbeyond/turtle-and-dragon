This is a simple Turtle Graphics engine that allows the user to give
commands to a drawing 'turtle' Java object based on a limited
set of object methods.

The instructions for the turtle should be given in the 'run' function
of the Instructions class.

To open the window and see the results of running the instructions,
run Turtle.java.
